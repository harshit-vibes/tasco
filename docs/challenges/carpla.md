## Problem Statement 1: One-Way Car Rental Operations

### Challenge Overview

VTC Go app allows customers to rent a car in one location and return it in another city - a **unique feature in the Vietnam market** that outcompetes all current platforms.

### Business Segments

| Segment | Duration | Market Size |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **B2B** | 1 month to 6 months | Sizable, stable |
| **B2C** | 4 hours to 1 month | Massive potential |

### Rental Pricing Model

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Minimum Duration** | 4 hours |
| **Maximum Duration** | No cap (1 month, 3 months, 6 months+) |
| **Pricing Basis** | Time-based |
| **Distance** | Surcharge if above threshold |

### Current Capability

- Cars can be picked up and returned at any of 70+ service centers/showrooms
- Fleet consists of new GWM (Haval) cars
- GPS tracking system in place to locate vehicles

### The Core Problem

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Demand Imbalance** | Cars returned to low-demand locations sit idle |
| **Rebalancing** | How to move cars back to high-demand areas cost-effectively |
| **Monetization** | How to generate revenue from cars in low-demand locations |
| **Operations** | Complexity of managing fleet across multiple cities |
| **Cost Effectiveness** | Optimizing operational costs while offering flexible returns |

### Strategic Priority

> "This is a strategic priority. If we are able to achieve this optimization, we can surely take the market forward."

The one-way rental feature is Carpla's key differentiator - solving the rebalancing problem is critical for scaling.

### Business Model Comparison

| Aspect | Other Platforms | Carpla/VTC Go |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Fleet Ownership | Partner-owned / aggregated | Own fleet |
| Pick-up/Return | Same location only | One-way (different locations) |
| Service Network | Limited | 70+ service centers + 200 showrooms |

### Current Technology

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **GPS Tracking** | In place - can track car locations |
| **Digital Keys** | Opportunity area - not yet implemented |
| **Remote Monitoring** | Opportunity area |
| **Telematics** | Opportunity for insurance integration |

### Insurance Workflow

| Insurance Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Vehicle Insurance** | Traditional car insurance (included) |
| **Travel Insurance** | Similar to flight insurance (optional, being implemented) |

### Current Rental Process (Manual - Opportunity for AI)

```
Before Rental:
Staff + Customer → Take photos → Record car status

After Return:
Staff → Take photos → Compare with before → Assess damage → Apply fees if needed
```

**Pain Point**: This process is very manual. Opportunity for:
- AI visual recognition for damage detection
- Automated comparison
- Fraud prevention
- Efficiency improvement

### Opportunity Areas

1. **Digital Keys**: Lock/unlock cars remotely
2. **Remote Monitoring**: Full vehicle telemetry
3. **Insurance Integration**: Telematics-based insurance (Tasco Insurance synergy)
4. **Demand Prediction**: AI for fleet rebalancing decisions
5. **AI Visual Recognition**: Automated car condition assessment

## Problem Statement 2: Service Center Quality & Growth Management

### Challenge Overview

Scaling quality service operations from a few shops to a nationwide network of 70 service centers.

### Three Core Pain Points (from CEO)

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **1. Service Standardization** | Quality varies between main cities and provincial areas. How to ensure consistent service standards, people quality, and processes across all 70 locations. |
| **2. Supply Chain Forecasting** | Multi-brand service means diverse spare parts. Need to forecast demand, stock right parts, and focus technical assistance on specific brand problems in certain areas. |
| **3. Business Decision Making** | Making operational decisions across 70 showrooms with diverse data and contexts. |

### Scale of Complexity

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Geographic Diversity** | 70 locations across Vietnam (main cities + provincial) |
| **Brand Coverage** | All car brands in the market (not just Tasco brands) |
| **Model Variety** | Hundreds of car models vs. 10-15 in single-brand shops |
| **Spare Parts** | Massive inventory of parts for all brands/models |
| **Technical Expertise** | Must train staff on unique problems per brand |
| **Quality Consistency** | Maintaining service quality across all locations |

### Comparison: Single Brand vs. Multi-Brand Service

| Aspect | Single Brand (e.g., GWM Shop) | Carpla Service Centers |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Car Models | 10-15 models | All brands, all models |
| Spare Parts | Limited, predictable | Massive, complex |
| Training | Focused | Broad expertise needed |
| Processes | Standardized | Must adapt per brand |
| Technical Problems | Known, documented | Diverse, brand-specific |

### Key Requirements

1. **Quality Control**: Consistent service quality across 70 locations
2. **Scalability**: Systems that work as network grows
3. **Inventory Management**: Spare parts forecasting for all brands/models
4. **Training & Standards**: Uniform processes across diverse services
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track quality metrics per location
6. **Technical Knowledge Base**: Brand-specific problem resolution
