## Challenge: End-to-End Material Planning & Management

### Problem Overview

Material cost represents the **highest proportion** of project costs. Need AI solution to manage the full lifecycle of materials with real-time visibility and predictive capabilities.

### Material Lifecycle Stages

```
Planning → Procurement → Supply to Site → Usage on Site → Finalization/Acceptance
```

### Current Approval Structure

| Level | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Top Leadership** | Final approval authority |
| **Planning Department** | Project planning approval |
| **Procurement Department** | Material purchase approval |
| **Project Management (Site)** | On-site execution and reporting |

### Current Tools

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Email** | Document exchange and communication |
| **Zalo** | Group communication |
| **Viber** | Group communication |
| **Microsoft Word** | Specifications, project plans |
| **Microsoft Excel** | Calculations, material tracking |

### Pain Points

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **No Coherent View** | Tools are isolated - different files here and there, no unified project overview |
| **No Real-time Updates** | Management doesn't know site progress in real-time |
| **Manual Data Retrieval** | Personnel must manually extract and analyze project information |
| **People-Dependent Predictions** | Material planning depends on individual expertise and availability |
| **Update Delays** | Inventory levels and progress can be delayed 1 day to 1 week |
| **No Just-in-Time Delivery** | No accurate system for timely material delivery |
| **Pattern Analysis Gap** | Cannot easily see material usage patterns across project timeline |
| **Cost/Risk Analysis** | Manual analysis of raw material price changes and associated risks |

### Current Process Flow

```
Planning Stage
     ↓
Email/Zalo/Viber coordination
     ↓
Excel-based calculations and tracking
     ↓
Multiple approval levels (top leadership → planning → procurement → site)
     ↓
Manual site updates (delayed reporting)
     ↓
Manual data compilation for analysis
```

## Requirements

### AI Solution Expectations

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Full Lifecycle Management** | Planning → Procurement → Supply → Usage → Finalization |
| **Real-time Visibility** | No delays in inventory levels or project progress updates |
| **Pattern Recognition** | See material usage patterns along project timeline |
| **Price Change Analysis** | Detect and analyze raw material pricing changes |
| **Cost & Risk Analysis** | Automated analysis of cost implications and material risks |
| **Predictive Power** | Forecast when to buy and replenish inventory |
| **Decision Support** | Intelligence support system for better decision-making |
| **Multi-Project Overview** | Coherent view across all 20+ simultaneous projects |

### Specific Capabilities Needed

1. **Data Retrieval & Analysis**
   - Extract information from existing project management data
   - Analyze patterns across 6-month (typical) project timelines
   - Aggregate data from isolated tools (emails, Excel files, etc.)

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Site progress updates visible to management immediately
   - Inventory level tracking without day/week delays
   - Task completion status from site to top level

3. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Material demand forecasting
   - Just-in-time delivery planning
   - Inventory replenishment recommendations

4. **Decision Support**
   - Cost impact analysis when raw material prices change
   - Risk assessment for material-related decisions
   - Planning recommendations based on historical patterns

## Q&A Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What would be POC success?** | AI system that retrieves and analyzes project information, detects material usage patterns, and provides decision support |
| **Do you have proper processes?** | Yes - established enterprise with proper procurement, supply, and project management frameworks |
| **Legal team size?** | 3 persons handling compliance and legal procurement for all 20 simultaneous projects |
| **Main pain points?** | Isolated tools, no real-time updates, people-dependent predictions, manual data retrieval |
| **Current communication tools?** | Email, Zalo, Viber groups |

## Technical Considerations

### Data Sources to Integrate

- Email archives (documents, communications)
- Excel files (calculations, plans, specifications)
- Chat histories (Zalo, Viber groups)
- Existing project records

### Challenges

| Challenge | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Data Fragmentation** | Information spread across multiple isolated tools |
| **Unstructured Data** | Chat messages, email threads, varied Excel formats |
| **Multi-site Operations** | 20 simultaneous projects across Vietnam |
| **Approval Complexity** | Multiple levels and departments involved |
| **Vietnamese Language** | Documents and communications in Vietnamese |

## Key Differentiators for Success

1. **Clear Pain Point**: Material costs are highest proportion of project costs
2. **Scale**: 20 simultaneous projects = significant impact potential
3. **Established Processes**: Proper frameworks exist - need digital enablement
4. **Real-time Gap**: Current 1-day to 1-week delays create clear improvement opportunity
5. **Decision Support Focus**: Want AI to assist, not replace human decision-making
6. **Full Lifecycle Scope**: End-to-end visibility from planning to finalization

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Update Latency** | Real-time (vs current 1 day - 1 week delay) |
| **Project Visibility** | Coherent view across all 20+ projects |
| **Material Prediction** | Accurate just-in-time delivery |
| **Cost Analysis** | Automated price change impact assessment |
| **Decision Support** | AI-powered recommendations for material planning |
