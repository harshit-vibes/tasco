Problem Statement:
Large training demand but a thin pool of qualified internal trainers. Inability to hold continuous offline classes. Converting PowerPoint slides into SCORM e-learning lessons currently takes weeks. Difficult to scale team capability alongside growth speed.

Relevant AI Technologies
Generative AI (text, image, video, code generation), Document Intelligence (data extraction from PDFs, forms, contracts), Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics
Reduce claims ratio and risk of technical loss. Increase profit margin through intelligent policy and resource allocation. Raise the "level" of risk management and compliance.

Message to Startups:

In an increasingly competitive market, Tasco Insurance sees technology-driven operational innovation as a critical lever for sustainable growth—beyond simply expanding headcount. We are looking for practical, execution-focused innovation, not conceptual demos.

We prioritize solutions that:

Are end-to-end or modular, allowing phased deployment.
Are realistic for Vietnam’s insurance context, without heavy upfront investment.
Can be piloted quickly and scaled progressively across the organization.
Our mindset: AI + Workflow digitization + Real operational impact Not perfect. Not expensive. But sharply focused on solving the real pain points of an insurance business.

Current Solutions
Many decisions are still based on delayed, manually processed Excel reports.

Target Users / Teams Impacted
Executive Board, Finance – Accounting Board, Risk Board; Branches & Sales department; Compliance & Control department.

Data Availability & Readiness

Integration, Deployment, and Infrastructure Requirements
