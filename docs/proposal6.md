Project Details
Problem Statement
Business Information
Tan Phu Viet Nam Joint Stock Company (https://inochi.vn/?view=en) or Inochi is a high-end household goods brand belonging to Tan Phu Vietnam Joint Stock Company – a member of DNP Corp with 48 years of experience, inspired by the Japanese meaning of "Life". Inochi owns 4 factories, 2 consecutive times achieving the Vietnam National Brand title, achieving rapid growth, along with a widespread distribution system. Inochi's development orientation focuses on cooperation in the fields of Green Materials & Technology (using 100% virgin plastic, Ag+ antimicrobial technology), Lifestyle Personalization (over 656 Japanese-standard design SKUs, high-end Aoi product line), and Digital Transformation & Customer Experience to create a comfortable, safe, and sustainable lifestyle for Vietnamese families.

Problem Statement
Sales data (Haravan) and invoicing/revenue data (Fulfillment, Bravo) are not synchronized and are updated manually, leading to daily delays and data discrepancies (specific delay level and discrepancy rate need to be quantified). This affects continuous order processing and automatic daily revenue/debt recognition.

Budget Allocation
TBD (To Be Determined)

Preferred Collaboration Timeline
PoC (Proof of Concept) 3 months, followed by official deployment.
