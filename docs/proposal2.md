Project Details
Problem Statement
Business Information
Tasco Group is one of Vietnam’s leading corporations in automotive services and smart transportation infrastructure, with a growing footprint across mobility, insurance, finance, investment, and urban services. Established in 1971 and listed on the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HUT – HNX), Tasco has continuously evolved to build an integrated ecosystem that serves both individual consumers and businesses nationwide.

Guided by the vision “to be the first choice for automotive services and smart transport infrastructure in Vietnam,” Tasco operates a comprehensive value chain spanning manufacturing, distribution, sales, services, and digital mobility platforms. Through Tasco Auto and VETC, the Group works with 16 global automotive brands, operates 163 showrooms, and serves over 4.1 million car owners, processing approximately 2 million transactions per day across its mobility platforms. The Group maintains strong strategic partnerships with leading global organizations, including Geely Auto, Mitsui & Co., and IFC (World Bank Group).

In late 2025, Tasco successfully completed the acquisition of DNP Holding, strengthening Tasco’s presence in water and environmental infrastructure, reinforcing the Group’s long-term commitment to sustainable development and essential public services alongside its core mobility businesses.
