Proposal for [INC4] AI Rules Engine System for Promotion Overlap Control at Inochi

Project Details
Problem Statement
Business Information
Tan Phu Viet Nam Joint Stock Company (https://inochi.vn/?view=en) or Inochi is a high-end household goods brand belonging to Tan Phu Vietnam Joint Stock Company – a member of DNP Corp with 48 years of experience, inspired by the Japanese meaning of "Life". Inochi owns 4 factories, 2 consecutive times achieving the Vietnam National Brand title, achieving rapid growth, along with a widespread distribution system. Inochi's development orientation focuses on cooperation in the fields of Green Materials & Technology (using 100% virgin plastic, Ag+ antimicrobial technology), Lifestyle Personalization (over 656 Japanese-standard design SKUs, high-end Aoi product line), and Digital Transformation & Customer Experience to create a comfortable, safe, and sustainable lifestyle for Vietnamese families.

Problem Statement
Inability to track the effectiveness and overlap of multiple promotions simultaneously due to manual management via Excel/email, leading to lack of synchronization, systematic issues, and potential errors/overlaps between customers, products, and time. (Time spent on manual updates and current error/overlap rate need to be quantified).

Relevant AI Technologies
Other: AI Rules Engine/Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Alerting/Notification System, API Integration

Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics
Scope of Work
Collect all current & historical promotions.
Design AI rules + machine learning system to analyze promotions.

Alert Sales/Marketing about risks.
Automate daily/weekly/monthly promotion reports.
Deliverables
AI system for promotion checking – analysis – alerting.
Promotion Dashboard by customer/product group/sales channel.

Data Availability & Readiness
Data for all current & historical promotions (information on customers, products, time, application conditions) is needed. This data is structured (Database/Spreadsheet) and needs to be integrated with sales data.

Integration, Deployment, and Infrastructure Requirements
Requires designing an AI Rules Engine and integrating it with sales data (possibly via API) to check promotion application. A system for automated alerts and reports (via Email/Zalo/System) needs to be built.

Budget Allocation
TBD (To Be Determined)

Preferred Collaboration Timeline
PoC (Proof of Concept) 3 months, followed by official deployment.
