Problem Statement
Technology systems, operating procedures, risk management, and compliance have not kept pace with the company’s growth rate. Data is fragmented across multiple systems, making it difficult to analyze operational efficiency and risk in near real-time. Many management and operational decisions are still based on delayed, manually processed Excel reports, which limits timely visibility into risk exposure and business performance. This creates challenges in proactive risk monitoring, compliance oversight, and management decision-making.

Relevant AI Technologies
Data Integration & Standardization, Multi-Dimensional Profitability Analysis, Early Warning System/Alerting (Loss Ratio, Claim), Policy/Resource Recommendation

Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics
Reduce claims ratio and risk of technical loss. Increase profit margin through intelligent policy and resource allocation. Enhanced risk management and compliance capabilities.

Message to Startups:
In an increasingly competitive market, Tasco Insurance sees technology-driven operational innovation as a critical lever for sustainable growth—beyond simply expanding headcount. We are looking for practical, execution-focused innovation, not conceptual demos.

We prioritize solutions that:

Are end-to-end or modular, allowing phased deployment.
Are realistic for Vietnam’s insurance context, without heavy upfront investment.
Can be piloted quickly and scaled progressively across the organization.
Our mindset: AI + Workflow digitization + Real operational impact Not perfect. Not expensive. But sharply focused on solving the real pain points of an insurance business.

Current Solutions
Many decisions are still based on delayed, manually processed Excel reports.
