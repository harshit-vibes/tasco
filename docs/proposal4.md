Computer Vision (image/video recognition, OCR), Document Intelligence (data extraction from PDFs, forms, contracts), Other: Process Automation/RPA, API Integration

Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics
Scope of Work
Collect and standardize customer order templates.
Train AI OCR to recognize item codes, quantities, customers, selling prices, etc.
Build a data processing pipeline and connect API to Bravo.
Deploy a review and approval interface for SOs before recording them in the system.
Test – calibrate – acceptance.
Desired Products
AI OCR Module + automated SO creation system.
Bravo connection API.
Dashboard to monitor the order entry process.
Reduce data entry time, reduce errors, increase Sale Admin efficiency.
Current Solutions
Manual entry into the Bravo system.

Target Users / Teams Impacted
Sale Admin
Order Management Department (CCU)
Data Availability & Readiness
Data required: current customer order samples (PDFs, images) to train the AI. This is unstructured data. Standardized information on item codes, quantities, customers, selling prices is required.

Integration, Deployment, and Infrastructure Requirements
Requires API connection to the Bravo system (ERP/Accounting) for automatic SO creation. A user interface for checking and approving the SO before recording it to the system needs to be built.

Budget Allocation
TBD (To Be Determined)

Preferred Collaboration Timeline
PoC (Proof of Concept) 3 months, followed by official deployment.
