Problem Statement
Tasco Insurance is experiencing rapid growth in the motor vehicle segment, leading to a sudden surge in claims, causing backlogs, slow processing, high pressure on staff, and risk of fraud. The initial damage assessment process is still predominantly manual, relying on individual experience, which is prone to slowness, inconsistency, and lack of standardization.

Relevant AI Technologies
Predictive Analytics / Forecasting, Recommendation Systems / Personalization, Search & Knowledge Retrieval

Expected Outcomes / Success Metrics
Reduce quotation time to < 1 minute/vehicle. Increase contract closing rate. Improve profit margin through accurate pricing and risk control. Build Tasco's professional, digitized image.

Build a dynamic pricing model based on behavioral data: vehicles (telematics), infrastructure equipment, ESS (Energy Storage System), pipelines, etc.

Message to Startups:
In an increasingly competitive market, Tasco Insurance sees technology-driven operational innovation as a critical lever for sustainable growth—beyond simply expanding headcount. We are looking for practical, execution-focused innovation, not conceptual demos.

We prioritize solutions that:

Are end-to-end or modular, allowing phased deployment.
Are realistic for Vietnam’s insurance context, without heavy upfront investment.
Can be piloted quickly and scaled progressively across the organization.
Our mindset: AI + Workflow digitization + Real operational impact Not perfect. Not expensive. But sharply focused on solving the real pain points of an insurance business.

Current Solutions
Tasco's quotations are still mainly Excel-based (5–10 minutes/vehicle).
