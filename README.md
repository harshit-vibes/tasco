2. **Fragmented → Unified**: Data scattered across Excel, email, chat needs consolidation
3. **Delayed → Real-time**: Updates taking days/weeks need to be instant
4. **Reactive → Predictive**: Moving from historical analysis to forecasting
5. **People-dependent → System-driven**: Reducing reliance on individual expertise
6. **Cost Optimization**: Clear ROI targets (50% reduction common)
7. **Vietnamese Context**: Local ERPs (Bravo), apps (Zalo), language support needed
