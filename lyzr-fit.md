## Recommendation

Focus on the 4 LLM-centric challenges for Lyzr demos:

1. **Compliance Document Governance** (Tasco Group) - Classic RAG use case
2. **Service Center Quality** (Carpla) - Technical support KB
3. **AI E-Learning Factory** (Tasco Insurance) - Training/onboarding KB
4. **Sales Order Automation** (Inochi) - Document parsing with LLM

For the remaining 17 challenges, Tasco needs ML platforms, computer vision solutions, or custom data engineering - not an LLM platform.
